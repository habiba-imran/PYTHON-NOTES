# Broadcasting
# stretching te size of smaller array so that it matches size of a larger array

# NumPy compares shapes from right to left:
# If dimensions are equal → ✅ OK
# If one dimension is 1 → it can be stretched to match the other
# If dimensions differ and neither is 1 → ❌ Error

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a + 10)  # [11 12 13]
# The scalar 10 is broadcast to [10, 10, 10]

b = np.array([10, 20, 30])
print(a + b)
# [[11 22 33]
# [14 25 36]]
# b is treated as if it were:

#  [10, 20, 30]]

# a.shape = (3, 1)   # 3 rows, 1 col
